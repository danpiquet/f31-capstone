# Bite-Sized Budgets
The primary goal of this project is to enable families to teach kids about finance and budgeting. Good financial habits develop early in life and allowing kids to see how to break their money down into trackable, bite-sized budgets is a great start.

Bite-Sized Budgets is a web app created by Dan Piquet.

## <a name="run"></a>How to locally run Bite-Sized Budgets

Bite-Sized Budgets has not yet been deployed, so here is how to run the app locally on your machine.

 * Set up your C++ dependencies
 	* `source ./bootstrap.sh`
 * Compile your source
    * `source ./build_osrm.sh`
 * Run OSRM
   * "Running OSRM" is here https://github.com/Project-OSRM/osrm-backend/wiki/Running-OSRM 
   However, this is exactly what you need to do for There and Back Again:
  	* `osrm-extract san-francisco_california.osm.pbf -p profiles/foot_crime.lua` (the `*.osm.pbf` file is downloaded from [here](https://mapzen.com/data/metro-extracts))
  	* `osrm-prepare san-francisco_california.osrm -p profiles/foot_crime.lua`
  	* `osrm-routed san-francisco_california.osrm` -- this command is what will actually start your server, as long as the last two steps were successful; you can now go to `localhost:5000/viaroute?â€¦` as described [here](https://github.com/Project-OSRM/osrm-backend/wiki/Server-api#service-viaroute)

### Run the There and Back Again Flask App

  * Set up and activate a python virtualenv, and install all dependencies:
    * `pip install -r requirements.txt`
  * Make sure you have PostgreSQL running. Create a new database in psql named lotr:
	* `psql`
  	* `CREATE DATABASE lotr;`
  * Create the tables in your database:
    * `python -i model.py`
    * While in interactive mode, create tables: `db.create_all()`
    * Seed the crimes table with crime latitudes and longitudes: `CrimePoints.seed_points()`
  * Now, quit interactive mode. Start up the flask server:
    * `python server.py`
  * Go to localhost:9000 to see the web app


## <a name="use"></a>How to use There and Back Again

###Enter starting point and destination, then click `Find a Path`
Two routes will appear on the map. The red route is the regular walking route returned by the MapBox Directions API. The golden route is the custom route returned from OSRM that routes the pedestrian around paths with high crime density.

The walking directions will also slide down at this time.

###Press the `Generate Heat Map` button
This button will query the database for all the crime occurrences in the bounding box of the current route. It will display these points as a heat map overlaying the map. Press 'Hide Heat Map' to make the heat map go away.

###Press the `View Crime Density Graph` button
This button will query the database for all points within 5 meters of the safe route, and represent that data as a graph to the user. This graph shows the user how the crime density changes throughout the course of their journey.
